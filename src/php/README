    - Support-custom-writeMessageBegin-functions.patch
        - If you use the PHP Binary Extension, this patch makes the binary
          extension support custom writeMessageBegin functions from the
          protocol specific user-land class. This is needed so we can
          pass trace_id, span_id, span_parent_id into each RPC request.
